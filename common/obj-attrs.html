<h1 id="object-attributes">Object Attributes</h1>
<p>Object Attributes are used to control various properties of created objects.
When specified as an option, either the raw bitfield mask or &quot;nice-names&quot; may be
used. The values can be found in Table 31 Part 2 of the TPM2.0 specification,
which can be found here:</p>
<p><a href="https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/TPM-Rev-2.0-Part-2-Structures-01.38.pdf">https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/TPM-Rev-2.0-Part-2-Structures-01.38.pdf</a></p>
<p>Nice names are calculated by taking the name field of table 31 and removing the
prefix <strong>TPMA_OBJECT_</strong> and lowercasing the result. Thus, <strong>TPMA_OBJECT_FIXEDTPM</strong> becomes
fixedtpm. Nice names can be joined using the bitwise or &quot;|&quot; symbol.</p>
<p>For instance, to set The fields <strong>TPMA_OBJECT_FIXEDTPM</strong>,
<strong>TPMA_OBJECT_NODA</strong>, and <strong>TPMA_OBJECT_SIGN_ENCRYPT</strong>, the argument
would be:</p>
<p><strong>fixedtpm|noda|sign</strong></p>
